# pyjail-ctf-chall
Explore the creation of PyJail CTF challenges in this series. Weâ€™ll dive into techniques for developing secure yet tricky Python sandbox (PyJail) challenges, focusing on bypass methods and potential pitfalls. Perfect for CTF creators and enthusiasts looking to understand or create PyJail scenarios

### Tips:

##### To make challenge harder:
1. Adding more items to the blacklist
2. Restricting more built-in functions
3. Adding input length limits
4. Adding more sophisticated input validation
5. Using custom import hooks to further restrict imports
6. Adding rate limiting or attempt counting

###### To make challenge easier:
1. Remove some blacklist items
2. Allow more built-in functions
3. Add hints in the welcome message
4. Include some example valid commands

###### Common techniques players might use:
1. String introspection
2. Class hierarchy exploration
3. Finding subclasses that provided access to system functions
4. Using type objects to access restricted functionality
5. Converting strings to different representations to bypass filters

##### Remember to:
1. Never run CTF challenges as root
2. Run in a container or VM if possible
3. Ensure the flag file has appropriate permissions
4. Monitor system resources to prevent abuse
5. Consider adding a timeout mechanism for long-running code
